Some of the commands used to assist in securing systems for the Collegiate CyberDefense Competition.

Post 2019 WRCCDC thoughts from a 2nd place finisher:
1. Need to focus on that dialing in the inital network diagram and pinpoint which boxes are being scored. Nmap is great for listining the boxes, but knowing how they are linked needs improvement. Diagrams provided can help, but usuall only include names. 

2. Password change management sharing amongst team mates. Our system involved sheets of paper with passwords on them and blank lines to the right to include the box and username. Using loose sheets of paper made things tricky as they would get moved around the room.

3. Pushing updates from the windows update server / group policy management. We could have saved a lot of time by knowing active directory better.

4. Knowing what services should / should not be running on Linux or Windows. Makes it easier to pinpoint vulnerable or malicious services running.
